# Ideas  
- Middle and end of verses should be in 4  
- Start with the rumba switch thingy from that one rumba we've done a few times recently  
- Maybe put a ronde cha cha box in the bridge? Or a serpiente?   
- Stomps at end of bridge?   
- Sweethearts could be relevant

# Notes  
- You don't want to do an aida out of a chase with triple chas because you aren't holding hands  
- Traveling doors in the pre-chorus is bad  
- Can't do triple chas in only one direction on the chase  
- Cucarachas in post-chorus need to do something more natural to face
