# Notes  
- the feather finish after the outside spin in the verse wants to end diagonal line and center, but currently ends diagonal line and wall  
- should the thru and chasse to semi be a forward and chasse to semi, since it outside spin ends in banjo(?)  
- I want the ending to have this kind of bouncing from one foot to the other feel that I've felt with the endings of other dances, but I don't know the right words to say for this. "Promenade sway" feels like it implies something too flowy rather than sharp, but maybe I'm just used to having it in waltz.
