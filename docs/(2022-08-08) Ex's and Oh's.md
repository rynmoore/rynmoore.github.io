# Notes  
- Rock recover to sailor shuffles gets off the music  
- Chasse left and right out of an American spin either needs to be cued very early or needs to change  
- In the interlude the right turning throwaway is "overturn to reverse"  
	- The kick ball changes afterwards need to be cued early
