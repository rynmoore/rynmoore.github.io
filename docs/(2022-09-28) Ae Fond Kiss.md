- Twist vine 6 with double twirl probably doesn't need to say twist vine, it could just be a vine?

# Known/Suspected Problems  
- Verse 1/4 has the wrong parity of footedness, I think  
- I'm not entirely certain you're allowed to do two twirl vines in a row, but I claim you should be allowed to :P  
- Back waltz -> twinkle might have awkward footedness

# Notes  
- Twist vine to reverse should be normal vine  
- 2 twirl vines in a row is bad  
- Roll 3, spin maneuver is too hard for phase 2  
	- ~~Good but hard~~  
	- Aikfapptp cf;k nah

# Notes  
- Consider having the figure immediately before the back waltz also be in closed  
- Take the spin maneuver out   
- "Thru side close to face wall"  
- "Twist vine 6 with double twirl"  
- Twinkle doesn't feel good from closed  
	- Could do a thru twinkle, but checking  
	- Could do "back waltz drifting apart to thru twinkles"  
		- But that's cliche  
	- Back twinkle works, but need to be in sidecar (three back twinkles to face the wall)  
- Twist vine 6 to face reverse in closed -> Twist vine and maneuver
