# Ideas  
- Start with waiting a count of 8  
- Rest of intro is interesting positional stuff  
- Break is maybe in rumba? Maybe also the bridge?  
- Chorus is repetitive 8-count (8 of them), the second chorus is truncated (only first half of 8 eights)  
- Chorus should be relatively straightforward, but not boring  
- Kind of want a New Yorker next to a hand-to-hand  
- Lots of twirls and spins  
- No chases in the chorus  
- Two underarm turns in a row?  
- Pre-chorus and outro should have spot turns  
- Triple chas should go in there somewhere  
- Want to include chase with full turns  
- Interlude should have chasse  
- Are hitches cha?  
- Kind of want to end in close?   
- Shoulder to shoulder + hand to hand

# Notes  
- Hand to hand is bad  
	- Especially out of a new yorker  
	- Especially out of a fence line  
- Here's something that technically works  
	- Chase with underarm pass  
	- Alemana  
	- Reverse underarm turn; fence line in 4;  
	- Reverse twirl vine; cucaracha;  
	- Underarm turn; fence line in 4;  
	- Twirl vine; cucaracha  
- Except you shouldn't use this because it feels bad  
- Chase with triple chas need to be cued more clearly
