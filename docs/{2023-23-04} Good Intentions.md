# Notes  
- SHADOW turning basic  
- First full moon starts on the wrong foot (because riff turns take 4 steps)  
	- Could be New Yorker in 4  
- shadow turning basic follow syncopate to face can be used to get out of varsouvienne  
- Indicate how for to turn the syncopated turning basic  
- fix facing directions
