# Ideas  
- Odd numbered 8 counts of the choruses should be (blank) in 4  
- Lace ups should go...somewhere  
- Whale tail in bridge  
- "Ain't a double header if you lose your head" = hitch  
- Too fast for sand steps

# Known/suspected Issues  
- I'm not sold on the sliding doors in verse 2, particularly because it seems difficult to roll out of  
- Is it even possible to use two forward two steps to go from banjo facing line to open?  
- For the last chorus, all I'm really trying to say is "Take two measures to get to open with the follow on the inside" but I have no idea how to pronounce that  
- ~~It feels a bit repetitive. Not unreasonably so; it feels on par with a lot of the dances we dance, but it still might be too much. ~~  
- Take out the half of a traveling box
